This program in the C # programming language finds the sums of positive integers 
multiple of 4 from the interval from a to b. 
The user must enter into the form windows the numbers equivalent to the beginning of the numerical 
boundary a and the ending of the numerical boundary b.

In order to more convenient design, configuration, and separation of individual executable operations, 
this program is built on modules that, in turn, are built on classes interacting with each other. 
The use of modules and classes provides an improved understanding of the code, 
and therefore setting and subsequent modification of the source code of the program. 
This program consists of the following modules:

1) Program - the main entry point into the game application.
2) Form1 - the main form of the program.

The main module of Form1 contains the following main functions corresponding to the main 
buttons and text boxes on the form:

1) search button - finds sums of positive integers of multiples of 4 from the interval from a to b;
2) Cancel button - clears input windows.
